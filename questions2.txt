1. Inline style CSS overrides rules defined in style elements and external style sheets because they are 
considered more local to the html document. Inline styles have highest priority, then embedded and lastly 
external CSS.

2. In CSS "id" should be used when we want a specific styling for a unique element in an html document. 
"class" should be used when we want to apply the same style to several different elements.

3. RGBA means "Red, Green, Blue, Alpha" and is a model for representing colors digitally. The alpha
value is normally used to represent opacity (level of transparency). It can represent 256 to the power of 3
different variations of color (16.8 million) and 256 levels of opacity.

4. We include CCS in the head element because it is considered best practice to link external resources in
the head tag.

5. The CSS selector that matches all the p elements inside the article element is "article p". By specifying
"article" we make sure that the "p" outisde of the article elements is omitted.
