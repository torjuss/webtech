1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?

    Because math operations on computers are performed with binary numbers and during
    transformation from decimal to binary there may be precision loss. For instance
    could "0.1 + 0.2" evaluate to 0.3000000005 instead of exactly 0.3.

2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?

    The method attribute specifies which method we should use to send the data in the form. GET is for
    data that are not sensitive and can be cached, whilst POST is for sensitive data that
    requires security (like passwords) and cannot be cached.

3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is changed to GET ?

    The form fields appear in the URL so that they can be cached and saved in bookmarks. Typically
    we use GET requests to fetch information or data and therefore it is nice to see the parameters
    that the method uses, and to be able to save a query.

4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or Javascript?

    You need server-side validation as well. Client-side validation (HTML and Javascript) is
    only meant to improve the user experience and make sure all input is specified. Users can
    still access server data without going through the form (web page) and do harmful things.

5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input ?

    When the user is prompted to write more than just a simple line of text. When several
    paragraphs are needed it is nice to see more than just one line of text at a time.
