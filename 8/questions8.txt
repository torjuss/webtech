1. What other context(s) can we get when calling getContext() on a Canvas element?

    We could get "null" if the context identifier is not supported.

2. How would you create a blue circle using the Canvas element? Explain with words or code.

    I would create a path and use the drawing routine arc to add lines to the circle.
    The following code, where "context" is the Canvas context, "r" is the circle radius and
    "(x,y)" is the coordinates of the circle center point, could be used:

    context.fillStyle = "blue";
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(x, y, r, 0, 2 * Math.PI, true);
    context.fill();
    context.closePath();

3. What is a more terse (also known as shorter) way of writing the loop in the following using the Array.filter method?

    You could use an anonymous filter function for each list element instead of using a for loop:

    const countries = ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'New Zealand'];
    var countriesStartingWithN = countries.filter(function(country) {
      return country.startsWith('N')
    });
