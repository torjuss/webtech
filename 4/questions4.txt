1. Mobile phones usually ignore autoplay on video elements because the bandwidth is often 
poor on mobile phones compared to devices that use only wi-fi or ethernet connection. Furthermore 
mobile phones usually have a plan with limited amount of data to spend so the user may want to 
limit how much content he downloads from the web, and a video is a lot of data compared to 
text and images.

2. The CSS snippet will hide all elements inside the element with id "logo". This is smart to
do when we want to hide items without deleting and recreating them, so that we can easily
show them again later. It is also different from "visibility: hidden" because the latter
still makes elements take up the same space as before, whilst "display:none" doesn't.

3. Advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions for mobile 
and desktop:

	a. Less maintenance and time spent on developing the site.
	b. Avoids code redundancy which reduces the risk for making errors during development.
	c. Users only have to care about one domain name for the page.
	d. Predictable behaviour (if the web developer has made a good responsive design).
	   The content of the page is the same no matter where it is accessed.
	e. Flexibility. Easy to make the page work for different devices and screen resolution.
	f. Reduces costs related to hosting the web page and buying a domain name.
