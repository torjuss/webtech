1. The difference between absolute and fixed position is that an element with fixed 
position is always positioned in relation to the browser window and is not affected by 
scrolling. Therefore it is often used for "sticky" navigation bars. An element with 
absolute position is positioned in relation to it's parent element. So if the parent is
larger than the browser window the element will follow the parent and may be invisible
unless you use the scrollbar.

2. We access the 3rd element within another element by using the CSS pseudo class 
":nth-child(n)" with n set to 3. For example you get the 3rd list item inside an 
unordered list with: "ul li:nth-child(3)".
